# TradePro1minScalper
This is an Expert Advisor for the MT5 platform, its based on the TradePro 1 min scalping video

I watched the TradePro YouTube video on the Fractal and Moving Average 1-minute scalping strategy, and I thought it would be interesting to code this strategy into an EA.
TradePro video = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=juZlrecsIts&t=3s&pp=ygUcdHJhZGUgcHJvIDEgbWludXRlIHNjYWxwaW5nIA%3D%3D

Side note. the video shows a profitable result; however, after some backtesting, it does yield some instating Pnl. Meaning if you want to make this EA profitable you have to add in extra things.
